<h1>FlickrDown Help</h1>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Step 1: Type in a flickr username, e-mail address, group or tags and click &quot;Lookup...&quot;</p>
<p>Step 2: If you want to download an entire set then click the checkbox
beside that set. If you want to download just a few selected photos
click the name of the set and all the photos for that set will appear.
Check the images you want to download</p>
<p>Step 3: Click the &quot;Browse...&quot; button and select a folder to download to.</p>
<p>Step 4: Click &quot;Download&quot;</p>
<h2>Authorization</h2>
<p>Authorization lets flickrdown see private pictures.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Photos will be download to a subfolder named after the set they are in</li>
<li>The [*All_Photos*] set is for photos not in a photoset.</li>
<li>Setting the Download Limit to a high number could make Flickrdown take a REALLY long time. Please do not abuse this setting. For example setting it 1000000 and downloading all images with the "flowers" tag will probably get you banned from flickr</li>
<li>This software is provided as is. No warranty what-so-ever.
Use at you own risk..</li>
</ul>
